        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>As the owner of a small to medium-sized business, Print On Namibia, I’m proud to run a local company that offers a
        variety of services including printing, branding, signage, embroidery, and more.
        I’ve always dreamed of creating a website for my business, and I believe this is the perfect opportunity to showcase my
        knowledge by putting everything I’ve learned into action.
        My website will include the following sections: Home Page, About Us, Catalogs, Portfolio/Gallery and Request a Quote</p>
